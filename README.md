**🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice**

Welcome! This is my personal repository for practicing and improving problem-solving skills in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
I'm actively preparing for interviews at product-based companies (Flipkart, Zomato, Razorpay, etc.), and this repo reflects my focused journey.

**📌 Goals**

Strengthen problem-solving skills in Core DSA

Cover all major patterns: Two Pointers, Intervals, DP, Heap, Greedy, Graphs

Track progress across platforms (LeetCode, GFG)

Build consistency and confidence for coding interviews
